# The amount of money a coin is worth. Creates a random number between

# Should coins be stacked? (Or should a coin be one on its own?)
# Stacked coins don't act like one coin. The stack is counted and the worth is multiplied.
# Not stacking coins is just for a cooler effect (but probably laggier).
stackCoins: false

# Put the amount of coins dropped for a specific mob here, by default: mobs drop one coin.
# ENDER_DRAGON is added by default, meaning that on kill of Ender Dragon, 64 coins drop.
# You can find mob types via this URL (types that aren't creatures will be ignored):

# When a player gets killed by another player, should (three; setting above) coins drop?
playerDrop: true

# And should coins NOT drop when both players have the same ip address?
# This means that no coin(s) will be dropped if both players are from the same computer.
# This prevents spam killing for unlimited money, unless you use this plugin for a local server.
preventAlts: true

# Should mobs from spawners drop a coin too?
# Mobs from spawners won't drop a coin by default.
spawnerDrop: false

# Should passive mobs also drop a coin?
# Passive mobs don't drop a coin by default.
passiveDrop: false

# Play a sound on pickup of a coin.
# This sound is a 1.9+ sound, if you use 1.8, put another sound in there.
# If the sound name remains untouched, and you use 1.8, it will do an 1.8 sound automaticly for you.
# Here is a list of 1.9+ sounds: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Sound.html
pickupSound: true
soundName: "BLOCK_LAVA_POP"

# Chance of dropping a coin after a mob has been killed.
# Value from 0.0 to 1.0: 0.0 meaning 0%, 1.0 meaning 100% (so 0.9 meaning 90%).

# Lets players use /withdraw <amount> to get a coin "<amount> <coin name>s": for example "53 Coins".
# This allows players to store the coins in chests, but won't be easier to give to others.
# When the coin gets dropped, and picked up after, give the player the amount of money the coin was worth.

# It shows a title (in the middle of the screen) how much they lost on death.
